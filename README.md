# plant-compatibility

This program will take in a csv file with a list of plant names, what plants
they are compatible with, and what plants they are not compatable with. Along
with this, the program will take inputs from the user for the dimensions of
their plant beds and the amount of room each plant will require.

With this information, the program can quickly calculate the pairing of plants
in each potting bed that uses the minimum amount of planting beds given the
dimensions.

This will save me a lot of time in the future. :)
